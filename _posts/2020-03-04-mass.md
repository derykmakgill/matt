excerpt: Automattic is still a startup — I’m sure there are deep-pocketed private equity firms that could have outbid us, but the most likely outcome then would have been an “asset” getting chopped up and sold for parts. (This is a caricature and there are PE firms I like, but it’s not a terrible stretch of the imagination.) Instead, Tumblr has a new chance to redefine itself in 2019 and beyond. Its community is joining with WordPress’ 16-year commitment to open source and the open web.

<p>I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>, but <em>dang</em> does the service get abused by folks aggressively opting you into mailing lists. I have a very early, very generic Gmail address that people put as a filler address into every possible service and it gets tens of thousands of list and spam mails. A good trick to find and unsubscribe from all the Mailchimp lists you’re on is to search for&nbsp;<code>mcsv.net</code>&nbsp;and then select all, report as spam, and unsubscribe. Gmail doesn’t deal well when the unsubscribe list is taller than your screen, so you may need to hit <code>command + -</code> a few times to make it all fit. Also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mailchimp/posts/10152104546810777">according to this post</a>, “you can also get in touch with our compliance team directly at <a href="mailto:compliance@mailchimp.com">compliance@mailchimp.com</a> with the email address you would like to remove from all lists and they will be happy to further assist you there as well.” I will try that as well.</p>
