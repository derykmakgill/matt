X-ray powder diffraction is a method of imagining crystals with x-rays. The diffraction pattern that comes from the crystal are concentric rings and the ring spacing can be used to infer the crystalline structure of the material.

In order to analyze the diffraction data, you have to convert from the CCD image of the diffraction pattern to physical scattering angles. This mapping requires knowledge of the detector geometry. In particular, the imaging detector can often be somewhat rotated, changing the observed circles into conic sections.

The detector geometry is typically computed using a calibration source with a known diffraction pattern. I wrote a least-squares fitting algorithm that can calibrate the diffraction detector by fitting a known calibration source. I then wrote code to uses the calibrations to perform a radial integral of the sample data which can be used to measure the diffraction peaks.
