<p>It is not surprising that the news about <a href="https://photomatt.tumblr.com/post/186964618222/automattic-tumblr">Automattic buying Tumblr</a> has <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/190812/p22#a190812p22">picked up a lot of coverage</a>. I especially appreciated the notes of support <a href="https://www.davidslog.com/186979222210/just-wanted-to-add-my-congratulations-and-thank">from Tumblr founder David Karp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1161015149563645953">former CTO Marco Arment</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bijan/status/1161295918123163648">investor Bijan Sabet</a>. I am beyond excited to see what the Tumblr team creates next, and I will definitely be connecting with alumni to hear their perspective.</p>




<p>There has also been a lot of speculation on the purchase price, which I think is missing the real story. I would like to take this opportunity to express my respect for Verizon and how they approached this entire process. They inherited Tumblr through an acquisition of a merger, a few steps removed from its initial sale; it’s probably not a company they would have bought on its own, but they nonetheless recognized that there is a very special community and team behind the product. It’s also worth noting at this point that Verizon is a company that <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news-tag/earnings-and-investor-conferences">will do over $130B in revenue this year</a> and has over 139,000 employees.</p>



<p>First, they chose to find a new home for Tumblr instead of shutting it down. Second, they considered not just how much cash they would get on day one, but also — and especially — what would happen to the team afterward, and how the product and the team would be invested in going forward. Third, they thought about the sort of steward of the community the new owner would be. They didn’t have to do any of that, and I commend them for making all three points a priority. </p>



<p><a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> is still a startup — I’m sure there are deep-pocketed private equity firms that could have outbid us, but the most likely outcome then would have been an “asset” getting chopped up and sold for parts. (This is a caricature and there are PE firms I like, but it’s not a terrible stretch of the imagination.) Instead, Tumblr has a new chance to redefine itself in 2019 and beyond. Its community is joining with WordPress’ 16-year commitment to open source and the open web. </p>
